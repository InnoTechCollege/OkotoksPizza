                    <h3>Made With Love</h3>
                    <p>There are no short cuts when it comes to our passion. We pull out all the stops,
                        giving you the
                        ‘wow’
                        flavour, experience and consistency you not only want, but deserve. Our customers keep coming
                        back,
                        again, again, and again.
                        We’re a small but nimble family-run take out and delivery pizza shop in Okotoks, Alberta. When
                        we’re
                        not
                        scouring the globe (okay, the prairies) for the freshest, ripest and boldest ingredients, we’re
                        crafting
                        perfect pizzas for you and your family to enjoy. From hot Hawaiians and classic Canadians to
                        crispy
                        wings and decadent fudge brownies, everything at Okotoks Pizza is baked with love.</p>

                    <h3>Quality Ingredients</h3>
                    <p>After watching his parents run a very successful pizza business in Calgary, Matt
                        Cleveland
                        learned
                        how to make people happy, one topping at a time. Opening the doors to Okotoks Pizza in 2004,
                        Matt
                        has managed to evolve the fresh, traditional Greek-style pizza his family perfected back in the
                        mid
                        80s to a more modern and convenient comfort food for today’s family on the go.

                        Okotoks Pizzas are made with only the freshest ingredients like mozzarella, roma tomatoes,
                        made-from-scratch sauce and even features premium toppings like Sorriso Pepperoni, salami from
                        Valbella meats and a healthy Flax crust. You feel good about ordering it. You feel good about
                        eating
                        it. And you feel even better knowing we're always ready to make you more.</p>
